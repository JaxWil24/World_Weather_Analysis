# World_Weather_Analysis
This challenge is an analysis of locations using API's and weather. The goal was to make a vacation spot by looking through the hotels generated by the API.![WeatherPy_vacation_map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106329824/187805919-91e01131-753d-4310-aa1b-7c01177346a6.png)
 Once a start location was selected(by me), I chose three other locations to make a road trip. Choosing from driving, biking, or walking, I also created a map that showed how to get to each place.![WeatherPy_travel_map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106329824/187805849-25405b26-e3d6-468e-9a1e-97850b2e1798.png)
 It was challenging but I understand now the importance of API and how it changes the game when it comes to information.
